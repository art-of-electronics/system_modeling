# System-modeling

My goal is to gather all possible chaotic systems 
and simulate their behaviour.

Chaotic systems count: **23 + 1**

Currently, I'm recreating and uploading 
1D mechanical / electrical systems 
in Python and Matlab / Simulink form. 
**TODO list**:
- [ ] Unbalanced 1DoF;
- [x] 1DoF with friction;
- [x] 2DoF;
- [x] RLC circuit;
- [ ] Electromagnetic relay;
- [ ] DC motor;
- [ ] BLDC motor;
- [x] Fluid flow;
- [x] Simple thermal;
- [x] Pendulum;
- [x] Parachute jump;

Have fun :)
